# Real-Time Human Activity Classification System

## Abstract
This project develops a real-time human activity classification system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. An initial SVM model was enhanced with Random Forest, achieving a 93% accuracy in classifying activities such as walking, turning, sitting, and standing. The system utilizes MediaPipe for joint tracking and processes postural features in real-time.

## Introduction
Automatic recognition of human activities has critical applications in physical rehabilitation, sports, and ergonomics. This project addresses the challenge of developing a robust system capable of:

## 1. Research Question
Main Question: How can we develop an accurate real-time system for human activity recognition and joint tracking using computer vision techniques?

Sub-questions:
- What are the most effective features to distinguish activities (walking, turning, sitting, standing)?
- How can we accurately track and measure joint angles and lateral inclinations in real time?
- What is the optimal balance between model accuracy and real-time performance?

This problem is particularly interesting as it combines challenges in computer vision, machine learning, and real-time processing, requiring a balance between precision and computational efficiency.

## Theory
### Key Components
1. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Ensemble of decision trees for robustness and generalization.
   - Effectively handles non-linear features.
   - Identifies feature importance.

2. **MediaPipe Framework**
   - Real-time pose detection system.
   - Provides 33 key joint landmarks.
   - 3D coordinates (x, y, z) for each point.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Normalization**: Standardized joint coordinates to eliminate dependence on subject height or camera distance.
   - **Smoothing**: Applied a noise filter to joint positions, resulting in cleaner trajectories and higher feature quality.
   - **Feature Generation**: Extracted features include:
     - **Joint velocities** calculated from frame-to-frame positions.
     - **Relative joint angles** to understand body posture.
     - **Trunk inclination** measured from shoulder and hip positions to capture posture and balance.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Collection Plan**:
  1. Record videos of subjects performing specific activities.
  2. Ensure diversity in subjects, perspectives, and movement speeds.
  3. Use indoor and outdoor environments for robustness.
- **Initial Data Requirements**:
  - Minimum of 20 subjects.
  - 5 repetitions of each activity per subject.
  - Multiple camera angles (front, side, 45 degrees).

### 2. Processing Pipeline
```python
# Normalize the data
data_normalized = normalize_data(df.copy())

# Smooth the data
data_smoothed = smooth_data(data_normalized.copy())

# Generate features
data_features = generate_features(data_smoothed.copy())
```

### 3. Model Implementation
```python
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),  # Standardize features
    ('classifier', RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)) # Use RandomForest
])

# Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
param_grid = {
    'classifier__n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],  # Number of trees
    'classifier__max_depth': [None, 10, 20],      # Maximum depth of trees
    'classifier__min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]   # Minimum samples required to split an internal node
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy', n_jobs=-1) # 5-fold cross-validation
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

```python
with mp_pose.Pose(min_detection_confidence=0.5, min_tracking_confidence=0.5) as pose:
    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        # Convert image to RGB and process with MediaPipe
        rgb_frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        results = pose.process(rgb_frame)

        # Convert back to BGR for OpenCV display
        image_bgr = cv2.cvtColor(rgb_frame, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)

        if results.pose_landmarks:
            # Draw joint points on the image
            mp_drawing.draw_landmarks(image_bgr, results.pose_landmarks, mp_pose.POSE_CONNECTIONS)

            # Extract x, y, z coordinates for all 33 key points
            landmarks = results.pose_landmarks.landmark
            frame_landmarks = []

            # Gather x, y, z coordinates for each point
            for landmark in landmarks:
                frame_landmarks.extend([landmark.x, landmark.y, landmark.z])

            # Ensure frame_landmarks has exactly 99 features
            frame_landmarks = np.array(frame_landmarks).reshape(1, -1)  # (1, 99) for model input

            # Perform prediction
            prediction = model.predict(frame_landmarks)
            action = prediction[0]

            # Display the action on the video window
            cv2.putText(image_bgr, f'Action: {action}', (10, 30), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (255, 0, 0), 2)
